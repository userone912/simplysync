- **Direct navigation** - "Set Up Sync" button takes users directly to settings
- **Multi-language support** - Seamless language switching without UI disruption

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **State Management**
- **BLoC Pattern** - Predictable state management with focused responsibilities
- **Separated Concerns** - Individual BLoCs for different app areas:
  - `ServerConfigBloc` - Server configuration and connection testing
  - `SyncedFoldersBloc` - Folder selection and management
  - `SyncOperationBloc` - Sync operations and progress tracking  
  - `AppSettingsBloc` - App settings and permissions

### **Background Processing**
- **WorkManager** - Reliable background sync with Android optimization
- **Isolate-based sync** - Heavy operations run in separate threads
- **Smart scheduling** - Respects system constraints and battery life
- **Persistent storage** - SQLite database for sync history and settings

### **Network Layer**
- **Protocol abstraction** - Unified interface for all sync protocols
- **Connection pooling** - Efficient reuse of server connections
- **Automatic retry** - Intelligent handling of network failures
- **File verification** - Checksum validation for data integrity

## üì± Quick Setup

   - Choose protocol (FTP/SSH/WebDAV)
   - Enter server details or WebDAV URL
   - Test connection with browse button

2. **Folder Selection** 
   - Pick common media folders or custom paths
   - Use remote browser to set server destination

3. **Sync Schedule**
